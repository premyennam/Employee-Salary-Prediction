# Employee Salary Prediction

This project predicts whether an employee earns more than 50K or less/equal based on various personal and professional attributes. It uses the UCI Adult Income dataset and is deployed via Streamlit.

---

##  Features

- Predict salary class (>50K or â‰¤50K) based on:
  - Age, education, occupation, work hours, experience
  - Workclass, relationship, marital status, gender, race
  - Capital gain/loss, education-num, native country, etc.
- Supports both **single input** and **batch CSV predictions**
- Built with a **scikit-learn pipeline**, including preprocessing
- Interactive **Streamlit app** frontend
